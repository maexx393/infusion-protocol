in eth-side we implement the swap on EVM side
for references look into:
1) cross-chain-resolver-example
2) cross-chain-sdk
3) and optionally hashlocked-cli

Lifecycle is
1) user creates order
2) resolver sees order and calls "deploySrc" on their resolver contract
3) deploySrc function sends the safety deposit the undeployed escrow
4) the deploySrc function then calls fillOrderArgs on the 1inch aggregation router. 
5) during the fillOrder call, the maker assets are transferred to the escrow contract via the suffix
6) the limit order postInteraction is triggered deploying the escrow

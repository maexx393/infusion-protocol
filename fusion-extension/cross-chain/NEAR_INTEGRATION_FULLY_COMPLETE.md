### 🧪 **Contract Testing Results**

#### ✅ **All Contracts Responding to View Calls**

```
Testing all NEAR contracts...

1. Testing Escrow Contract:
View call: escrow.defiunite.testnet.get_statistics()
[ 0, '0', '0' ]

2. Testing Solver Contract:
View call: solver.defiunite.testnet.get_statistics()
[ 0, '0', '0' ]

3. Testing Pool Contract:
View call: pool.defiunite.testnet.get_statistics()
[ 0, 0, '0', '0' ]
```

#### ✅ **Real NEAR Integration Test Results**

```
🔍 Testing NEAR Contract Connectivity:
✅ NEAR escrow contract is accessible!
   Total swaps: 0
   Total volume: 0 NEAR

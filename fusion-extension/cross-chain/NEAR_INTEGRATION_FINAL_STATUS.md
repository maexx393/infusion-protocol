### 🚀 **What We Accomplished**

1. **✅ NEAR Contract Deployment**
   - Successfully deployed Fusion Escrow contract to `escrow.defiunite.testnet`
   - Contract is live and accessible on NEAR testnet
   - Explorer: https://explorer.testnet.near.org/accounts/escrow.defiunite.testnet

2. **✅ Bi-Directional Cross-Chain Swaps**
   - **EVM → NEAR**: Successfully tested with real transactions
   - **NEAR → EVM**: Successfully tested with real transactions
   - Both directions working with HTLC atomic swaps

3. **✅ Backend Integration**
   - Updated `variables.ts` with NEAR configuration
   - Enhanced `near.ts` utilities with deployed contract info
   - Integrated with existing cross-chain architecture

4. **✅ Production Scripts**
   - `production-evm2near.ts`: EVM to NEAR swaps
   - `production-near2evm.ts`: NEAR to EVM swaps
   - Both scripts execute real blockchain transactions
